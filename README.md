# Fingerproxy

Inspired by [gospider007/fp](https://github.com/gospider007/fp). Fingerproxy is an HTTPS reverse proxy. It creates JA3, JA4, Akamai HTTP2 fingerprints, and forwards to backend via HTTP request headers.

```
         TLS                            HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2
Client ------>   Fingerproxy    ------------------------------------>  HTTP Backend
                (listens :443)    | With request headers:        |    (127.0.0.1:80)
                                  | X-JA3-Fingerprint: abcd...   |
                                  | X-JA4-Fingerprint: t13d...   |
                                  | X-HTTP2-Fingerprint: 3:100...|
```

Fingerprints can be used for bot detection, DDoS mitigation, client identification, etc. To use these fingerprints, just extract the HTTP request headers in your backend apps.

Fingerproxy is also a Go library, which allows users implementing their own fingerprinting algorithm.

## Usage

> [!TIP]
> Try fingerproxy in 1 minute:

1. Generate a self-signed certificate `tls.crt` and `tls.key` for testing.
    ```bash
    openssl req -x509 -newkey ec -pkeyopt ec_paramgen_curve:secp384r1 -days 3650 \
      -nodes -keyout tls.key -out tls.crt -subj "/CN=localhost" \
      -addext "subjectAltName=DNS:localhost,DNS:*.localhost,IP:127.0.0.1"
    ```

2. Download the [fingerproxy binary](https://github.com/wi1dcard/fingerproxy/releases) and run. The TLS server listens on `:8443`, forwarding requests to [httpbin](https://httpbin.org/).
    ```bash
    ./fingerproxy -listen-addr :8443 -forward-url https://httpbin.org
    ```

3. We are ready to go. Send a request to fingerproxy:
    ```bash
    curl "https://localhost:8443/anything?show_env=1" --insecure
    ```

    You will see that fingerprints are in HTTP request headers:

    ```yaml
    {
      "headers": {
        # ...
        "X-Forwarded-Host": "localhost:8443",
        "X-Forwarded-Port": "443",
        "X-Forwarded-Proto": "https",
        "X-Http2-Fingerprint": "3:100;4:10485760;2:0|1048510465|0|m,s,a,p",
        "X-Ja3-Fingerprint": "0149f47eabf9a20d0893e2a44e5a6323",
        "X-Ja4-Fingerprint": "t13d3112h2_e8f1e7e78f70_6bebaf5329ac"
      },
      # ...
    }
    ```

For all available CLI options, see `fingerproxy --help`.

## Production-Ready

The fingerproxy binary is production-ready. [Subscan.io](https://www.subscan.io/) has 12 fingerproxy instances running in the production environment, which process almost 40,000,000 requests/day on average.

Unit tests, memory usage tests, E2E tests, and benchmarks have been implemented and run on GitHub Actions.

And of course, fingerproxy follows SemVer.

## Kubernetes and Prometheus Integration

Kubernetes liveness probe support is available since [v0.3.0](https://github.com/wi1dcard/fingerproxy/releases/tag/v0.3.0). Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: fingerproxy
spec:
  containers:
  - name: fingerproxy
    image: fingerproxy
    livenessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /
        port: 443
        scheme: https
```

Kubernetes probes use certain User-Agent such as `kube-probe/1.26`. Therefore, those requests with the specific user-agent header can be recognized as probing requests. Instead of forwarding to the backend app, fingerproxy will simply respond with an `HTTP 200` by itself.

The default Prometheus metrics server listens on `:9035`. Once new requests come in, run `curl http://localhost:9035/` to see avaialble metrics.

## Implement Your Fingerprinting Algorithm

Check out the example [`customize-fingerprint`](example/customize-fingerprint/). No code fork needed.

## Use as a Library

Fingerproxy is degigned to be highly customizable. It is separated into serveral packages. You can find all packages in the [`pkg`](pkg/) dir and use them to build your own fingerprinting server.

Here is an example [`echo-server`](example/echo-server/). Instead of forwarding HTTP requests, it simply responds back to client with the fingerprints.

## Similar Projects

- [gospider007/fp](https://github.com/gospider007/fp)

  Great implementation based on golang net stack, works nice with golang HTTP handler. Fingerproxy rewrites TLS ClientHello capturing according to it.

  Why I didn't use it?

  - The JA3 and JA4 implementations contain bugs. For example,
    - In [fp.go](https://github.com/gospider007/ja3/blob/a58a93a771b99909e859ead9a9492015dd916947/fp.go#L337), `_` should be used instead of `,` as the separator of extensions and signature algorithms.
    - In [fp.go](https://github.com/gospider007/ja3/blob/a58a93a771b99909e859ead9a9492015dd916947/fp.go#L80), the protocol version in ClientHello handshake should be used for JA3.
    - In [ja3.go](https://github.com/gospider007/ja3/blob/a58a93a771b99909e859ead9a9492015dd916947/ja3.go#L769), `;` should be used instead of `,` as the parameters separator in HTTP2 settings frame.
    - Priority frame used in HTTP2 fingerprinting has not implemented yet.
  - KISS
    - JA4H can be calculated in backend applications. Do not do it in the reverse proxy.
    - Complex design, unused methods, and copy-pastes from unknown source.

- [wwhtrbbtt/TrackMe](https://github.com/wwhtrbbtt/TrackMe)

  An HTTPS echo server that responds the fingerprints.

  Why I didn't use it?

  - It is not designed for forwarding the requests.
  - Bugs too. In [ja4.go](https://github.com/wwhtrbbtt/TrackMe/blob/41b7933efe9ea364ade88ac6ea0e79a7b0203227/ja4.go#L85), the padding extension (21) somehow has preserved. Therefore there would be two duplicated `21` extension which is incorrect.
